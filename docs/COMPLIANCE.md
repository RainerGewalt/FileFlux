# Compliance & Data Integrity

> **Honest scope.** TrailTransfer is open-source software. Software cannot *be*
> "GMP compliant" or "Part 11 certified" on its own — compliance is a property of
> a *validated system in a controlled process*. TrailTransfer is **designed to
> support** data integrity (ALCOA++) and to be **validatable** by the operator.
> It makes no certification claim. This page maps features to expectations and
> states clearly what the operator must provide.

## ALCOA++ mapping

| Principle | How TrailTransfer supports it |
|---|---|
| **Attributable** | `worker_id`, `command_hash`, and a self-declared `issuer` (command `operator`); strong identity via broker ACL/mTLS (operator) |
| **Legible** | structured JSON, `schema_version`, published JSON Schemas (`schemas/`) |
| **Contemporaneous** | `recorded_at` (ISO 8601 UTC) at seal time; `time_source` declared; NTP is operator responsibility (ISO 27001 8.17) |
| **Original** | the sealed journal record is the original; hashes fix its content |
| **Accurate** | `rclone_exit_code`, transfer counters, captured errors; optional file manifest (v0.3) |
| **Complete** | completed **and** rejected jobs are recorded; journal + fsync; store-and-forward planned |
| **Consistent** | monotonic `seq` + `prev_hash` hash chain (chronological, gap-detecting) |
| **Enduring** | append-only journal on a durable/WORM volume; chain recovered on restart |
| **Available** | `trailtransfer verify` + the plain-text journal; readable without any service |
| **Traceable** | chain of custody: issuer → policy (`policy_hash`) → execution → sealed result |

## EU GMP Annex 11 / 21 CFR Part 11 (indicative)

| Expectation | TrailTransfer | Operator provides |
|---|---|---|
| Audit trail: secure, time-stamped, computer-generated | sealed result records, hash-chained | retention store, review process |
| Audit trail not alterable | tamper-evident chain + `verify` | WORM storage, access control |
| Access / authority checks (Annex 11 §12) | policy allowlists; command schema | broker auth + ACL, mTLS, RBAC |
| Electronic records retained & retrievable | JSONL journal, `verify`, export | retention period, backup |
| Electronic signatures (Part 11 Subpart C) | envelope prepared for Ed25519 (v0.3) | signature policy, key mgmt |
| Data integrity & time | JCS hashes, ISO 8601, `time_source` | NTP; optional RFC 3161 TSA |

*Indicative only — not a gap assessment. Map against your own SOPs.*

## GAMP 5 / CSV

TrailTransfer is small, deterministic and testable (see `go test ./...` and
`docs/EVIDENCE_MODEL.md`). For validation: treat it as configurable software,
trace your **user requirements** to the policy + MQTT contract + evidence model,
and use `verify` and the example commands as **OQ** evidence. `policy_version` /
`policy_hash` and `worker_version` in every record support change control.

## Shared responsibility (summary)

**TrailTransfer provides:** canonical hashing, hash-chained tamper-evident
records, append-only journal, independent `verify`, policy enforcement + policy
hash, structured/versioned events, JSON Schemas.

**The operator provides:** NTP time sync; broker authentication, ACLs and TLS/mTLS;
a WORM/immutable retention store and retention/disposal policy; backups; key
management (for signatures); and the **validation** of the deployed system against
their own regulated process.
